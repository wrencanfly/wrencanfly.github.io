### Teaching

**Peer Mentor, CS577: Computer Graphics**  
*University of Wisconsin–Madison, Spring 2023*

In Spring 2023, I served as a Peer Mentor for CS577 (Computer Graphics) at UW–Madison. I hosted office hours, graded assignments, and helped with course logistics and maintenance. It was a great semester working alongside Anchor Zhao and other friends on the teaching team — we had a lot of fun while supporting students and keeping the course running smoothly.
