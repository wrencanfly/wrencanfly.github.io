I am a master student in Computer Science at Brown University. My research is currently in an exploratory phase, but I am broadly interested in 3D reconstruction, diffusion-based generative models, video synthesis, and efficient learning methods. I am especially curious about how to build semantically meaningful and computationally efficient generative systems that can handle complex spatial and temporal data.

I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/) in 2025, where I worked with [Prof. James Tompkin](https://jamestompkin.com/) on neural rendering and representation learning using NeRF. Before that, I received my B.S. from the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) in 2023, double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science, with a minor in Math.

In the summer of 2024, I was a research intern at the [Harvard Visual Computing Lab](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), where I collaborated with [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/hanspeter-pfister) and [Dr. Wanhua Li](https://li-wanhua.github.io/) on 3D Gaussian Splatting with language-based supervision. In 2025, I interned at [Hedra AI](https://www.hedra.com/), working with [Hongwei Yi](https://xyyhw.top/) on diffusion-based video generation and efficient generative modeling.

Beyond research, I am especially fond of Siamese cats and rabbits.

A quote that resonates with me is from William T. Freeman: *“Slow down to speed up.”*
